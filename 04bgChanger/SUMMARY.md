# Summary of the Background Changer Project

## Background Changer Project

### Overview
This React project is a simple background color changer that allows users to dynamically switch the background color of the entire screen by clicking on different color buttons.

### Key Features
1. **State Management**  
   - Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the background color (`color` state).

2. **Dynamic Background Change**  
   - The `div` covering the full viewport (`h-screen w-full`) has its background color updated dynamically using inline styles.

3. **Color Selection Buttons**  
   - A set of buttons representing different colors.
   - Clicking a button updates the `color` state, changing the background instantly.
   - Each button is styled with its respective color.

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - Buttons are wrapped in a `div` with `flex flex-wrap justify-center` to ensure a neat and responsive layout.
   - Positioned at the bottom (`bottom-12 inset-x-0`).

### Technologies Used
- **React** (Functional Components, Hooks)
- **Tailwind CSS** (For styling and responsiveness)

### How It Works
1. The app initializes with a default background color (`Olive`).
2. When a user clicks a button, the `setColor` function updates the `color` state.
3. The `style` attribute dynamically applies the selected color as the background.

This project is a great beginner-friendly example of handling state and dynamic styling in React! ðŸš€
